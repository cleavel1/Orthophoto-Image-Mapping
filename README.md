# Orthographic-Photo-Mapping
## CSE 485/486 Capstone Project

In the Land Surveying industry, a common task is to take an orthophoto image taken via drone, and to map out various linework (e.g., property boundaries, road boundaries, parking spots, buildings, fields, etc.). Currently, this is done manually in a CAD, with employees dedicating their time exclusively to both tracing and labeling the linework.

The primary goal of this project is to simplify the CAD mapping process by delivering a software application that takes as input the drone image, processes the linework as a 2D graph object, and outputs a CAD file with the completed work. If performed at a high enough accuracy, such an application would significantly accelerate the mapping procedure. It would allow land surveyors to begin the manual process with QA on the auto-completed linework, instead of completing all linework by hand, so that they can quickly move on to other aspects (e.g., labelling).
